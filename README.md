# SentimentAnalysis_GetulioVargas
Sentiment analysis of GetÃºlioâ€™s Vargas famous speech during his Coup dâ€™Ã©tat in Brazil in 1937. In this project, I discovered the most common words he used in his speech text and found which category his speech fit, overall negative or positive content. Furthermore, my outcomes are shown through word clouds, graphs, tables, and sentiment analysis scores.
